== Architecture Constraints
// Begin Protected Region [[]]

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Any requirement that constrains software architects in their freedom of design decisions or the development process.

.Motivation
Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design decisions and where they must adhere to constraints.
Constraints must always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

.Form
Informal lists, structured by the sub-sections of this section.

.Examples
see subsections

.Background information
In the optimal case constraints are defined by requirements. In any case, at least the architects must be aware of constraints.
The influence of constraints is described by [Hofmeister et al] (Software Architecture, A Practical Guide, Addison Wesley 1999)  using the term “global analysis”.
